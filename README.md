# Project Windfarm

- Synchronize pulses of light between independent microcontrollers
- Performs broadcast-based leader election without a shared clock
- Based on Moteino (with RF95 LoRa radio module)
- Each mote stores a unique ID in its EEPROM. Once that is configured (once), all code across all devices is identical
- Work in progress!
